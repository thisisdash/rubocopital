# Rubocopital

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/rubocopital`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubocopital'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

To use shared rubocop configuration in your respective app, you should include 
rubocopital's configuration like this:

```
  inherit_gem:
    rubocopital: 
      - default.yml
```

If you have specific configurations that differ from the agreed upon defaults,
you can just add them below.

```
  inherit_gem:
    rubocopital: 
      - default.yml

```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run 
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive 
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then 
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, 
push git commits and tags to gitlab.
